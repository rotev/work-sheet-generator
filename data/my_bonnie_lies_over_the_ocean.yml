song: |
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean
    My Bonnie lies over the sea
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean
    Please bring back my Bonnie to me

    Bring back, bring back
    Oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
    Bring back, bring back
    Oh bring back my Bonnie to me

    Oh blow ye winds over the ocean
    Oh blow ye winds over the sea
    Oh blow ye winds over the ocean
    And bring back my Bonnie to me.

    Bring back, bring back
    Oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
    Bring back, bring back
    Oh bring back my Bonnie to me

    The winds have blown over the ocean
    The winds have blown over the sea
    The winds have blown over the ocean
    And brought back my Bonnie to me.

    Bring back, bring back
    Oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
    Bring back, bring back
    Oh bring back my Bonnie to me
