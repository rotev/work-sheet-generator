song: |
    Five little chickadees
    Peeping at the door
    One flew away 
    And then there were four

    Chickadee, chickadee, happy today
    Chickadee, chickadee, fly away

    Four little chickadees 
    Sitting on a tree
    One flew away 
    And then there were three

    Chickadee, chickadee, happy today
    Chickadee, chickadee, fly away

    Three little chickadees
    Looking at you
    One flew away
    And then there were two

    Chickadee, chickadee, happy today
    Chickadee, chickadee, fly away

    Two little chickadees
    Sitting in the sun
    One flew away 
    And then there was one

    Chickadee, chickadee, happy today
    Chickadee, chickadee, fly away

    One little chickadee
    Left all alone
    It flew away 
    And then there were none

    Chickadee, chickadee, happy today
    Chickadee, chickadee, fly away
