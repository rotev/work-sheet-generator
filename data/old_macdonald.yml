    Old MacDonald had a farm,
    Ee i ee i oh!
    And on that farm he had some chickens,
    Ee i ee i oh!
    With a cluck-cluck here,
    And a cluck-cluck there

    Here a cluck, there a cluck,
    Everywhere a cluck-cluck
    Old MacDonald had a farm
    Ee i ee i oh!

    Old MacDonald had a farm,
    Ee i ee i oh!
    And on that farm he had some dogs,
    Ee i ee i oh!
    With a woof-woof here,

    And a woof-woof-woof there
    Here a woof, there a woof,
    Everywhere a woof-woof
    Old MacDonald had a farm
    Ee i ee i oh!

    Old MacDonald had a farm,
    Ee i ee i oh!
    And on that farm he had some turkeys,
    Ee i ee i oh!

    With a gobble-gobble gobble-gobble here,
    And a gobble-gobble gobble-gobble there
    Here a gobble-gobble, there a gobble-gobble,
    Everywhere a gobble-gobble-gobble
    Old MacDonald had a farm
    Ee i ee i oh!

    Old MacDonald had a farm,
    Ee i ee i oh!
    And on that farm he had some cows,
    Ee i ee i oh!
    With a moo-moo here,
    And a moo-moo there
    Here a moo, there a moo,
    Everywhere a moo-ooo
    Old MacDonald had a farm,
    Ee i ee i oh!
