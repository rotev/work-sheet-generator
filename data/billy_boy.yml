    Oh where have you been, Billy Boy,
    Billy Boy?
    Oh where have you been, charming Billy?
    I have been to seek a wife,
    She's the joy of my life,
    She's a young thing
    And cannot leave her mother.

    Did she bid you to come in, Billy Boy,
    Billy Boy?
    Did she bid you to come in, tell me Billy?
    Yes, she bade me to come in,
    There's a dimple in her chin.
    She's a young thing
    And cannot leave her mother.

    Did she set you a chair, Billy Boy?
    Billy Boy?
    Did she set you a chair, tell me Billy.
    Yes, she set for me a chair,
    She has ringlets in her hair,
    She's a young thing
    And cannot leave her mother.

    Can she bake cherry pie, Billy Boy,
    Billy Boy?
    Can she bake cherry pie, tell me Billy.
    She can bake a cherry pie,
    There's a twinkle in her eye.
    She's a young thing
    And cannot leave her mother.
